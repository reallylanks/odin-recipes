        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> One thing I look forward to during the holidays is pie. But not just any pie, this classic pumpkin pie recipe. Store-bought pie doesn’t come close to this homemade recipe. It has a creamy, rich, and silky filling, and the crust is golden and tender. It’s just sweet enough, thanks to the brown sugar, and is perfectly spiced.</p>
            <p> Even better, this pumpkin pie recipe is very straightforward. All you have to do is prepare the crust, whisk together the filling ingredients, and pour it into the partially baked pie crust. It also keeps well, so you can make it ahead of time to make preparing for the holidays stress-free.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <h3>Pasty Crust:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ cup shortening</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons cold water, or more as needed</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Filling:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups mashed, cooked pie pumpkin</li>
                <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger, or more to taste</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is moist enough to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed.</li>
                <li>Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Place a 9-inch pie pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut a circle of dough 1 1/2 inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discard dough scraps and set pie pan aside.</li>
                <li>Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; transfer it right-side up over the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pan. Use two hands to flute the dough around the top edges.</li>
                <li>Make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Pour into the prepared crust.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, 40 to 60 minutes. Cover the edges with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling cooks.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving.</li>
            </ol>
